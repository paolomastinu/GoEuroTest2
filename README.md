# GoEuroTest2
Improved Version

I have made an improved version of your test.
I have not create a CSV file, but a simple MVC where you have a form to input a city name and a view that display the results.

You can test my program downloading from target folder the goeuro.jar and launching it with this command line:

java -jar goeuro.jar

My program will launch a web application so you can go on your browser and see the form on:    http://localhost:8080/findCity

enter Berlin or Rome and you will see the results


Thank you
